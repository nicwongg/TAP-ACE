# TAP-ACE Assignment

### Running it locally

To run it locally, you can run the `flask run` command in the main directory.

### Hosting

The application is also hosted on: http://tap-ace.herokuapp.com (though there might be some cold start delays due to Heroku's dyno hibernation)

### Assumptions: 

1. The web application will only be used to store one round of team and match information.
2. There will always only have 4 teams of each groups to advance (no tying for two top 4 teams)
